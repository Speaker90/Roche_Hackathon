You need to store the data in this folder (CNN).
To train the model, you need to have keras installed with tensorflow as backend.

It takes about 33 hr to train the model on your computer and about 1 hr on google collab with GPU activated.

If you want to test the model, you can use the command:
  python train_CNN.py -m test_CNN.hdf5
  
 --> but you need the trained model test_CNN.hdf5 (I can send it to you).
